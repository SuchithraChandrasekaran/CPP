# What is GoogleTest?
GoogleTest (or GTest) is a C++ testing framework developed by Google for writing unit tests. 
It provides a rich set of assertions, test fixtures, and test runners, making it easy to test C++ code effectively.

## Key Features of GoogleTest:
1. Supports test discovery and automatic execution

2. Provides a wide range of assertions (EXPECT_*, ASSERT_*)

3. Supports test fixtures for setup and teardown

4. Allows parameterized tests for testing multiple inputs

## How GoogleTest is Used in Unit Testing
Unit testing is a process where individual components of a program are tested in isolation. 

GoogleTest helps write unit tests efficiently by providing a framework for defining and running tests.

## Steps to Use GoogleTest in a C++ Project
1. Install GoogleTest

2. Clone the repository or install via package managers (e.g., apt, vcpkg).

3. Build it using CMake.

4. Write Test Cases

5. Include the gtest/gtest.h header.

6. Define test cases using the TEST() macro.

7. Compile and Run Tests

8. Link your test program with GoogleTest.

9. Run the executable to see test results.
